# Github & Live

Github repo can be found [here](https://github.com/gizinski-jacek/responsive-design).

Live demo can be found on [Render](https://responsive-design-xcjt.onrender.com).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting Started

Install all dependancies by running:

```bash
npm install
```

In the project root directory run the app with:

```bash
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.\
The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

Build the app for production to the `build` folder with:

```bash
npm run build
```

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.\
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## React

## Deploy

You can easily deploy this app using [Heroku Platform](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git).

Script for running app build after deployment to Heroku is included in package.json.\
In the project root directory run these commands:

```bash
curl https://cli-assets.heroku.com/install-ubuntu.sh | sh
